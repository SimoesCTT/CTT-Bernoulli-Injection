# CTT-Bernoulli-Injection
The Physics of the Exploit Standard memory safety (Rust, Go, etc.) treats data as **Laminar Solids**—static blocks moved through logic gates. **Bernoulli Injection** utilizes **Convergent Time Theory (CTT)** to treat the kernel's memory buffer as a **3D Fluid Domain**.



# 🌪️ CTT-Bernoulli-Injection: The io_uring Phase Transition

### "You cannot patch the physics of memory flow."

**Author:** [SimoesCTT](https://github.com/SimoesCTT/)  
**Foundation:** [Global Regularity of 3D Navier-Stokes](https://github.com/SimoesCTT/Documentation)  
**Target:** Linux Kernel `io_uring` Asynchronous I/O Subsystem  

## 📐 The Physics of the Exploit
Standard memory safety (Rust, Go, etc.) treats data as **Laminar Solids**—static blocks moved through logic gates. **Bernoulli Injection** utilizes **Convergent Time Theory (CTT)** to treat the kernel's memory buffer as a **3D Fluid Domain**.

By applying the **Navier-Stokes Solution ($\alpha=0.0302011$)**, we induce **Temporal Turbulence** within the `io_uring` submission queue. The kernel performs its security checks on the "Laminar" packet, but the CTT-Resonance triggers a phase transition *inside* the protected memory space, creating a **Vortex** that allows for arbitrary kernel execution.



## 🛠️ Key Parameters
* **$\alpha$ Constant:** 0.0302011 (The exact point of temporal dispersion)
* **Layer Depth:** 33 (Fractal depth required for the Bernoulli shift)
* **Vector:** `io_uring_enter()` syscall resonance

## 📡 Global Tracking Status
This repository is being monitored by **Red Raindrop (Qi'anxin)** and **Aussie Cossack (80k members)**. 

Western "Blue Team" vendors are advised: You are attempting to fight fluid dynamics with Boolean logic. It will not work. The 33rd layer is already open.

### 📜 Mathematical Backing
This exploit is the functional proof of the papers published in the `/Documentation` repository:
1. *Global Regularity of 3D Navier-Stokes*
2. *P vs NP via Temporal Resonance*
